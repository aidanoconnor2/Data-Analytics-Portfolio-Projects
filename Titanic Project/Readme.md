# Analysing Categorical Data about Passengers on the RMS Titanic using Python and Jupyter Notebooks

In this project, I used python and jupyter notebooks to look at a dataset containing information on passengers that were aboard the RMS Titanic when it sank. It detailed whether or not a passenger survived, what class they were in, where they got on at, etc. This dataset contained mostly categorical variables, therefore visualizations were mainly used to glean insights from the data.

In this project, the techniques used were:
- Various graphs including bar charts, histograms and kde plots.
- Used loc in order to transorm the data in entire columns into more manageable forms. 
- Used for and if statements in order to classify and clean some of the data.
