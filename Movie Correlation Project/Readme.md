# Analysing Numerical Data from IMDb using Python and Jupyter Notebooks

In this project, I used python and jupyter notebooks to compare some of the numerical data in a dataset from IMDb. Specifically, I looked at what correlated best with a movie's gross revenue at the box office. However, before the analysis, I first had to clean the data.

The techniques I used in this project were:
- Removing duplicates using dropna.
- Converting data types of some columns to make data manipulation easier.
- Removing duplicates with drop_duplicates
- Taking the age rating and assigning a ranked number system to it in order to check how it correlates with gross revenue.
- Creating scatter plots to view the linear relationships between gross revenue and various other numerical data.
- Using pandas to check how gross revenue correlates with other fields such as budget and runtime etc.
